    <ul>
      <li>Sep 1 - starting off same as end of Aug
      <li>Sep 17 - mid-month update
      <li>Sep 25 - Updated Service provider content. Also, added new category called "Addons" which holds some database entries for items the service proivider sells that aren't channels/networks. Examples are "[DVR]" referring to the provider's base DVR service if they have one. Another example is "Enhanced Cloud DVR" which may refer to an upgraded DVR service. Other examples are additional concurrent stream packages or bundles of other packages which do contain channels/networks. Best place to see this is the "My Networks" sheet, scroll to the right, see the "Addons" category column. Mark any of them you want to include in the Analysis. These "non-network addons" are defined in the Data sheet and priced in the WhatIf sheet. Also updated the Services sheet with current info.
