<p>An update for Feb of 2021. <a href="/Feb 2021 - Cord Cutting Wizard - Public.xlsx">Feb 2021 - Cord Cutting Wizard - Public.xlsx</a>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Feb 1 - starting off same as end of Jan 2021
      <li>Feb 12 - mid-month update of all services
      <li>Feb 27 - End of month update of all services. Corrected T-Vision entries from Jan 2021 and Feb 2021 - didn't realize some networks that were listed in their html page were marked inactive. I had them as active in Jan 2021, so I reversed those in that month's file. They are correct in Feb 2021. Also updated the CCW_Trend.xlsx change log which had sucked in those incorrect entries when I posted it last month. See change log for the database <a href="/CCW_Trend.xlsx">CCW_Trend.xlsx</a>
