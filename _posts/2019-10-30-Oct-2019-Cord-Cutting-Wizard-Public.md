<p>An update for Oct of 2019. <a href="/Oct 2019 - Cord Cutting Wizard - Public.xlsx">Oct 2019 - Cord Cutting Wizard - Public.xlsx</a>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Oct 1 - starting off same as end of Sep
      <li>Oct 11 - updated all Services for new or changed content
      <li>Oct 27 - updated all Services for new or changed content. Note: Fubo TV is a bit weird. Several channels are listed under multiple Add-ON Packages and they have bundles which reduce the pricing of combined Add-On Packages. This tool doesn't account for that yet. Also Fubo TV offers additional channels/Add-On packages that are listed in the help section but not on their front facing web site. Not sure if that is old material or they are beging phased out or what. I excluded them from this tool. Example: AMC Premier
      <li>Oct 30 - finalizing end of month. PS Vue marked as excluded as it will cease to exist on Jan 1, 2020. See change log for the database <a href="/Sep 2019 to Oct 2019 - Cord Cutting Wizard - Change Log.xlsx">Sep 2019 to Oct 2019 - Cord Cutting Wizard - Change Log.xlsx</a>
