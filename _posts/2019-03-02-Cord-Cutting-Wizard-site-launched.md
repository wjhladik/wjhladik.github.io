I am Bill Hladik and as a hobby I created a Streaming TV Services descision making guide. I called it the Cord Cutting Wizard. I was able to go to the various Service provider web sites and semi-automate the gathering of what Networks they provide under their various base and Add-On Packages and for what price. I loaded it all into this spreadsheet wizard which I will update monthly. 
<p>You can use it if you are thinking of cutting the cord and you aren't sure what to buy. Just mark the Networks you care about watching and the wizard will analyze it all and tell you which one or two Services you should consider buying to give you the maximum number of Networks you marked at the lowest price. There are several controls you can apply to fine tune the analysis, but basically that's what it does.
  <p>There are similar "tools" and "comparison" web sites out there, but nothing as extensive as this information.
